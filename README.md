# Workplace Safety AI

**An AI-Powered PPE Detection System**

This project is an innovative deep-learning solution designed to enhance workplace safety.
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and object detection techniques, the system detects 
whether workers are complying with safety protocols (e.g., wearing helmets, gloves, and vests) in real-time video feeds.
