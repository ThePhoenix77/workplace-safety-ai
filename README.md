**An AI-Powered PPE Detection System**

This project is an innovative deep-learning solution designed to enhance workplace safety.
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and object detection techniques, the system detects 
whether workers are complying with safety protocols (e.g., wearing helmets, gloves, and vests) in real-time video feeds.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Develop an AI system that monitors workplace environments and detects safety violations.
- **Key Features:**
  - Real-time video processing using OpenCV.
  - CNN-based object detection for PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
  - Alerts and notifications for detected safety issues.
- **Target Industry:** Industrial, construction, mining, and manufacturing.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python (for AI prototyping)
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN development)
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages for the landing page demonstration
